## Check_IP (ip.sh)
The shell script that checks whether my current IP is in my "good IP" list. It saves bunch of time with oneclick for this half manual process.

## Reason

I was having a lot of packet loss with my connection to certain servers, (mostly gaming) the problem was network mapping with the given IP to the server. 

There was nothing that I can do to fix besides resetting my router to change my IP therefore, I came with the idea of storing my "good IP" that has no packet loss and good network mapping into a list thus, I will be able to check whether my current IP is in my "good IP" list if so, script will output me as "OK" with green colour hence, I will not be needing to reset my router.

If it does not say OK then it is not in my good network mapping IP list so I connect the server, if there is no packet loss, I add that IP into the list. (Yes I have more than 20 IP addresses, I think, in other words, I'm enumerating my ISP which actually I'm not interested..) 

Funny story right? Yes, it is ludicrous.
